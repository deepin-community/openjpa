The upstream tarball has been modified as follows, to comply with DFSG:

  * websphere_uow_api-0.0.1.* files were removed since those are part of
    IBM Websphere Application Server and this software is non-free.
    Those files were located at this directory:
    apache-openjpa-2.0.0-source/openjpa-kernel/internal-repository/com/ibm/websphere/websphere_uow_api/0.0.1
